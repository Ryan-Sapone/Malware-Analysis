<h1>Silly Putty Analysis</h1> 
This is the analysis for SillyPutty inside of Matt Husky's Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course. The goal of this challenge is to put some static and dynamic analysis tools and techniques to use and answer some questions about this potential malware. 

<h2>Static Analysis</h2>
<h3>Q1: What is the SHA256 hash of the sample?</h3>
To answer this, we have to simply hash the malware sample. In the terminal, we can type "sha256sum [FILE_NAME]" to get the SHA256 hash. We can also use "md5sum [FILE_NAME]" to get the MD5 hash as well. Let's save these as a note.

<h3>Q2: What architecture is this binary?</h3>
For this, we're going to use a tool called pestudio (available here: https://www.winitor.com). This is a tool that can help speed up the process of malware analysis, and you'll see in the screenshot below that it also gives you hashes of the file as well as the architecture.

<h3>Q3: Are there any results from submitting the SHA256 hash to VirusTotal??</h3>
This is an easy one - we should all (hopefully) be familiar with VirusTotal.

<h3>Q4: Describe the results of pulling the strings from this binary. Record and describe any strings that are potentially interesting. Can any interesting information be extracted from the strings?</h3>
We can use FLOSS to search for strings, or also look inside of pestudio as well. Inside of pestudio, you are able to sort the output and look for potential red flags of malware. Now for full disclosure, I was familiar with PuTTy as being a legitimate program, and going through some of the strings that were flagged or possibly suspicious, I thought that maybe this was a legitimate program, and that Matt was trying to trick us. When I went back to the walkthrough during this part, he did say that this section was meant to be difficult on purpose because PuTTy has certain API calls and edits to the registry that are part of the program itself. However, one of the things I did note down inside of my strings search was for HTTP requests and email addresses. By doing a Ctrl + F inside of the FLOSS output file, I noted one of the HTTP strings, but further investigation revealed it might just be a compiler and not a malicious request.

<h3>Q5: Describe the results of inspecting the IAT for this binary. Are there any imports worth noting?</h3>
I opened up the binary inside of PEview and looked at the Import Address Table. I then used a database for malicious API calls (https://malapi.io) and searched a few of them to try and get more information on what this binary might be trying to do. I had a little bit of luck in finding a few calls that could point to malicious activity.

<h3>Q6: Is it likely that this binary is packed?</h3>
By inspecting the virtual size and the raw data size and comparing the values, we can determine whether this binary is packed or unpacked. The calculations and comparison of both of these values is nearly identical, so we can accurately determine this is unlikely packed.
